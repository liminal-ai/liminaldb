# 05 - Product Iteration

Iterative A/B development phase. Building on stable architectural foundation to discover product-market fit.

## Approach

**Phase A (Build):** Ad-hoc iteration to working software. Explore, learn, ship.

**Phase B (Harden):** Tests, docs, standards alignment. Lock down what works.

## Stories

| Story | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Story 1: Shared Tags](./story-1-shared-tags.md) | 19 curated shared tags, chip selector UI | Planning |
| [Story 2: AI Prompt Creation](./story-2-ai-prompt-creation.md) | Chat-based form helper with cheap model | Planning |

## Backlog (in beads)

- `promptdb-aaz` - Tag Suggestions (P2)
- `promptdb-bzw` - Templates with Variables (P3)

## Context

From brainstorming session covering:
- Skills vs prompts (simplified to prompts only)
- Type field vs tags (tags only, no types)
- Custom vs shared tags (shared only, 19 fixed)
- Template complexity (deferred)
- AI inference tiers (cheap only, users bring premium)
- Apple UX philosophy (fewer features, polished)
