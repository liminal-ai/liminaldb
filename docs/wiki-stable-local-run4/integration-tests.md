# Integration Tests

## Overview

Comprehensive end-to-end integration test suite covering the full LiminalDB stack. The 16 test files (~2,650 LOC total) exercise authentication flows (API keys, cookies, MCP OAuth), health endpoints, the prompts CRUD API, Convex backend functions, user preferences, import/export, merge operations, and browser-level UI interactions. Nearly all tests depend on shared fixtures for environment configuration (`tests/fixtures/env.ts`) and authentication helpers (`tests/fixtures/auth.ts`), while the Convex-specific tests use the generated API types directly.

## Responsibilities

- Validate authentication mechanisms: API-key auth, cookie-based auth, and MCP OAuth flows
- Verify health and authenticated-health endpoints return expected status
- Test the prompts REST API for CRUD operations and edge cases
- Exercise Convex backend functions directly via the generated API client
- Test user preferences API endpoints
- Validate import/export round-trip data integrity
- Test merge operations for combining prompt collections
- Run browser-level UI tests for authentication and prompt management flows
