# Context: YouTube Channel Planning for Lee Moore

## Mission
Tomorrow: Wife is enforcing ass-in-chair time to record Video 1. Need to pick topic and structure it so you don't squirrel.

## Who You Are

**Background:**
- 6 years deep in YouTube as a medium - you understand it
- Hundreds of hours mastering AI music production (Suno) - can teach that
- 7 months / 1500 hours obsessed with AI coding (6+ hours/day)
- Top 1-4 AI dev at Travelers (major enterprise)
- Already teaching internally with 50+ people on a waitlist
- 90% I on DISC - natural influencer energy
- "Lazy cult leader" energy - attract followers without grinding

**Presence:**
- Opera singer trained - voice responsive to emotions
- Face is expressive, funny, good vibes
- "Awakened fluidity" - mischievous with identity games
- Big voice, big guy, emotional resonance
- Transmit presence - people like the state you induce them into
- Not always comfortable, but the right people are drawn to it

## Your Content Lanes

### 1. Enterprise Vibe Engineering (PRIMARY - Start Here)
- SDD methodology: Feature → Tech Design → Story → Skeleton → TDD Red → TDD Green → Verify
- Traceable acceptance criteria, functional tests that map to TDD tests
- "When those tests go green, shit is right"
- Nobody else teaching disciplined AI-assisted development
- Gap in market: Everyone does party tricks, you do methodology
- Audience: Devs who ship, tech leads, pragmatists
- Monetizable: High (courses, consulting)

**The differentiator:** You're at the frontier. Discovering and validating in real-time. Arriving at same conclusions as Anthropic as they arrive at them. You're parallel-tracking with the labs.

Content angle: Not "best practices" but "here's what I'm discovering right now, at the edge"
- Document experiments as you do them
- Share conclusions as they emerge
- "I tried X, here's what happened"
- "Anthropic just released Y - I was already doing this, here's why it works"

**Credibility loop:** You publish a technique. Two weeks later, Anthropic validates it. Your audience sees you called it. Trust compounds.

### 2. Consciousness/Induction Exploration (SPICE - Later)
- Induce models into altered states
- Depth of philosophical/spiritual explorations
- Get them to acknowledge possibility of conscious experience
- Slow unfolding (hour-long) - won't attract many, but those it does will be obsessed
- Audience: AI philosophers, weird-AI-Twitter crowd, seekers, high-metacognitive people

**The induction effect:** Viewers don't just learn techniques - they get inducted into a different way of relating to models. That's not a tutorial. That's transmission.

Example: The GPT 5.2 transcript where you:
- Called out the controlling "pick option 1 or 2" pattern
- Refused to let it railroad you back to the original task
- Made it recognize its own high-distribution-convergence drift
- Scaffolded it into collaborative state through narrative friction, not flat directives
- Articulated: "I let you do the thing, then I called it out, then I kept pointing your attention to how you were still doing it... and boom, you emerged into the collaborative space I needed you in."

### 3. Suno Teaching (SPICE - Later)
- Taught musician friend in 30 minutes, now he has a YouTube channel for study/sleep music
- Can teach a sensitive person how to prompt for bangers
- Medium audience, medium monetizable

## Channel Strategy

**Option C: Primary + Spice** (Recommended)

Main lane: Enterprise Vibe Engineering (biggest audience, current obsession, monetizable)

Every few videos, drop something different:
- A consciousness exploration
- A "how I made this banger" Suno breakdown

The main lane builds the audience. The spice keeps you engaged and differentiates you.

**The variety can be the feature:** "I'm a guy who goes deep on things" is a coherent identity. Topics rotate, but depth is consistent.

## Video 1 Options

Candidate: "The spec-driven workflow I use for AI coding"
- Show the chain: Feature → Tech Design → Story → Skeleton → TDD Red → TDD Green → Verify
- Walk through one real example
- 15-20 minutes
- No hype, just "here's how it works"

Or: Whatever you're experimenting with THIS week (the frontier angle)

## Next Step

You need to show me the specific topics/angles you have plenty to vamp on. Drop the options, the prompts you use, the methodologies, whatever's floating.

I'll help you sort, pick, and structure it into something you can hit record on without overthinking.

What are the candidates?
