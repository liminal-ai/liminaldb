$ARGUMENTS

Before reviewing, re-read the work you produced and any reference materials or source files you used to create it.

Then do a critical review and give me a thorough readiness assessment for the next phase. What was done well, not so well, and what do you recommend. Keep your responses clear, high signal, direct.
