$ARGUMENTS

Re-read the work you produced and any reference materials used. Read as if seeing it for the first time.

Evaluate against:
- **Correctness**: Accurate? Does what it should?
- **Completeness**: Anything missing?
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand? Unambiguous?
- **Consistency**: Follows established conventions?

Readiness assessment for next phase:
1. **Critical** (must fix before proceeding)
2. **Important** (should address)
3. **Minor** (nice to have)

Be specific and actionable.
