$ARGUMENTS

Re-read the work and the requirements or context it was based on. Review as a skeptical new team member who will inherit this.

**Assumptions audit:**
- What's implicit that should be explicit?
- What context exists in your head that isn't captured?

**Failure modes:**
- How could this be misunderstood or misused?
- What edge cases or scenarios are unhandled?

**Handoff test:**
- What questions would someone new have?
- What would cause confusion?

What's the biggest risk if we proceed as-is?
