$ARGUMENTS

Before reviewing, re-read the work you produced and any requirements or specifications it was based on.

Then put on a skeptical reviewer hat. What assumptions are we making that could be wrong? What edge cases or failure modes haven't been considered? If another developer had to pick this up tomorrow, what would confuse them or cause problems? Keep your responses clear, high signal, direct.
