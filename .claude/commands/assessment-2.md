$ARGUMENTS

Before reviewing, re-read the work you produced. Also look at similar existing files in the codebase to compare patterns and conventions.

Then review this work against those existing codebase patterns. Are naming, structure, and architectural decisions consistent with how similar things are done elsewhere in this project? What would make this feel more native to the codebase? Keep your responses clear, high signal, direct.
