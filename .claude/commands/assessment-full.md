$ARGUMENTS

Run three assessment passes in sequence. Re-read the work you produced before each pass.

---

**Pass 1 - Quality & Readiness**

Evaluate against:
- **Correctness**: Accurate? Does what it should?
- **Completeness**: Anything missing?
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand? Unambiguous?
- **Consistency**: Follows established conventions?

Categorize findings as Critical / Important / Minor.

---

**Pass 2 - Patterns & Consistency**

Find 2-3 similar existing artifacts in this project and compare.

- **Naming**: Follows project conventions?
- **Structure**: Organization matches similar artifacts?
- **Style**: Tone/format feels native to project?
- **Interfaces**: Boundaries and connections follow established patterns?

What feels foreign? What would improve fit?

---

**Pass 3 - Adversarial Review**

Review as a skeptical new team member who will inherit this.

- What assumptions are implicit that should be explicit?
- How could this be misunderstood or misused?
- What edge cases or scenarios are unhandled?
- What would confuse someone picking this up?

What's the biggest risk if we proceed as-is?

---

**Summary**: List the top 3-5 most critical items to address before proceeding.
