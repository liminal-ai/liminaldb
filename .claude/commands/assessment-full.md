$ARGUMENTS

Run three assessment passes in sequence on the work you have done. Keep each pass focused and distinct.

**Pass 1 - Quality & Readiness:**
What was done well, not so well, and what do you recommend for the next phase?

**Pass 2 - Patterns & Consistency:**
Is this consistent with existing codebase patterns and conventions? What would make it feel more native to the project?

**Pass 3 - Adversarial Review:**
What assumptions could be wrong? What edge cases or failure modes haven't been considered? What would confuse another developer picking this up?

After all three passes, provide a brief summary of the most critical items to address.

Keep your responses clear, high signal, direct.
